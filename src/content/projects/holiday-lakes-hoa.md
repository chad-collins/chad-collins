This was an exciting project for me, getting a chance to use my recent gridsome boilerplate to redesign a website for a local home owners association. The project utilizes a CMS to allow for the non techy employees to easily add posts, pages, and calendar events. It also gave me a chance to use my graphic design skills. While this project is closed-source, my boiler plate can be found on my project page [here](/projects/jamstack-blog-template/)).
